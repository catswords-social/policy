## XMPP (Messenger Service)

### What is XMPP?
XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open communication protocol primarily designed for instant messaging, presence information, and contact list maintenance. It enables decentralized, secure, and real-time communication between users across various platforms. XMPP is built on XML and allows the transmission of data between two or more entities, making it flexible for a wide range of applications, including messaging, presence updates, and collaboration.
