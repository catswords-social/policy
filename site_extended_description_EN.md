Catswords Colosseum operates user protection measures. In cases where there is a potential dispute, user protection measures may be taken. The procedure for user protection measures is as follows:

1. The user protection measure process begins with the reception of a dispute. The administrator is reachable through all available means. However, if the reception is by a third party, it may be rejected depending on the circumstances.
2. The original content creator's opinion, which caused the user protection measure process, is considered. Throughout the process, the content creator's intentions are prioritized.
3. Appropriate notification and argument procedures are conducted for all stakeholders.
4. The decision and notification of the user protection measure process are made.

The user protection measure process is initiated only after completing all these steps. However, in specific cases, the standard procedure may be skipped, and the administrator may exercise the user protection measure at their discretion.

Examples of cases subject to direct administrator action:

* Exposing genitals in content (video, photo, etc.) without appropriate audience settings, except for cases of legal, medical, academic consultation, or factual documentation, or when the content depicts non-human creations mimicking human forms.
* Content that supports acts of genocide, depicted by symbols such as the Hakenkreuz, Rising Sun Flag, IS Flag, or Z symbol.
* Posting information on the manufacture and distribution of prohibited items (e.g., drugs, firearms) excluding those permitted by South Korean law to qualify.
* Posting content related to child labor for those under 18, excluding cases for legal, medical, academic consultation, or public interest purposes.
* Posting content that induces suicide or self-harm for an unspecified or specific individual, except for cases where the intention is not to induce such actions against others and the content pertains to the poster's own situation, allowing time to secure assistance from relevant authorities.
* Posting content simulating terrorism, allowing time to secure assistance from relevant authorities.
* Posting content that promotes illegal gambling, with the criteria based on South Korean law or general societal norms.
* Posting content simulating criminal organizations or groups.
* Using the instance to harass individuals or groups (e.g., cyberbullying, hate speech).
* Using the instance with the intent to cause mental or physical harm to individuals or groups.
* Suspicion of accounts created by hackers or hacker organizations seeking financial support.
* Report of the use of copyrighted material beyond the scope allowed by prior public disclosure of the copyright.

License compliance is expected from all entities (e.g., humans, natural language processing, image processing machines) with learning capabilities, and if the entity intending to use the work is not a natural person, it must sufficiently demonstrate that the natural person representing the entity can comply with the license. Failure to do so may lead to the user protection measures mentioned earlier.

For situations where the administrator's normal functioning is not possible, the instance designates a legal representative with technical authority (hereinafter 'technical representative').

1. Administrator's death
2. Disappearance
3. Mental incapacitation or insanity
4. Detainment, hostage-taking, or captivity in a third country
5. Designation for arrest by domestic or international legal authorities
6. Hiding due to threats from criminal organizations or personal sanctions
7. Conscription due to war or similar national crisis
8. Inability to establish contact or locate for over 24 hours by any announced means
9. Other similar situations

In the event of a similar situation, the right transfer to the technical representative prevails over the administrator. If the technical representative does not exercise the right within 5 days of being notified (or from the day a third party informs the technical representative in the case of the representative being unlocatable), the right automatically transfers to the legal representative.

* Designated Technical Representative: Kim Junyoung (+82-0507-954-5188, juni65423@gmail.com)
* Scope of Technical Representative's Rights: All physical assets (servers, PCs, etc.), all electronic forms of inanimate objects (software, databases, files, etc.), all terms of cloud service contracts necessary to operate this instance
* Limits of Technical Representative's Rights: Technical representative's rights occur (are acquired) only in situations where the administrator's normal functioning is not possible.

If an unplanned connection failure persists for more than 3 hours, compensation for connection issues can be requested through the emergency contact. However, evidence must be submitted that proves an attempt to connect during the time of the connection failure. The range and compensation depend on the cause, scale of the failure, and the number of affected users, and the administrator makes the final decision.

By joining this instance, it is assumed that you agree to these rules.

These rules are effective from December 16, 2023, 09:00 UTC+9 (KST).
