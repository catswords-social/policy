Catswords Social implements user protection measures. Procedures for user protection can be initiated in all cases where there is a potential dispute. The user protection measures are carried out as follows:

1. The user protection process begins with the receipt of a dispute. It is possible to contact the administrator through all available means. However, if the complaint is submitted by a third party who is not directly involved, it may be rejected depending on the circumstances.
2. The opinion of the original content creator, which caused the user protection process, is considered. Throughout the process, the judgment prioritizes the intentions claimed by the content creator.
3. Appropriate notification and argumentation procedures are conducted for all stakeholders.
4. The decision on whether to proceed with user protection measures is made and communicated.

User protection measures are carried out after completing all of the above procedures. However, in specific cases, the regular procedure may be bypassed, and the administrator may proceed with user protection measures at their discretion.

* Contents (videos, photos, etc.) exposing genitals in content where humans are the subjects and posting them without appropriate audience restrictions. However, this exclusion does not apply in cases where there is a legal, medical, or academic consultation or when the content is a simple record without sexual intent or when the content is an artistic creation that imitates only the form of a person who is not the subject.
* Adult content that does not involve genital exposure is not subject to direct intervention but follows the general user protection procedure. However, if the content addresses social or political criticism, it may not be subject to user protection measures.
* Posting content (text, videos, photos, etc.) that supports acts of genocide. Examples: Hakenkreuz, Rising sun flag, IS flag, Z symbol.
* Posting information about the manufacturing and distribution of prohibited items, excluding those who are legally qualified in South Korea. Examples: narcotics, firearms.
* Posting content (text, videos, photos, etc.) regarding child labor involving individuals under the age of 18. However, this exclusion does not apply in cases where there is a legal, medical, or academic consultation or when the content serves public interest purposes.
* Posting content that induces suicide or self-harm to an unspecified group or specific individuals. However, if the content relates to the personal circumstances of the poster and is not intended to induce such acts toward others, direct intervention or delay may be allowed to secure the assistance of relevant organizations.
* Posting content simulating acts of terrorism. However, direct intervention or delay may be allowed to secure the assistance of relevant organizations.
* Posting content that promotes illegal gambling. However, the determination of whether the content promotes illegal gambling refers to South Korean law, publicly available jurisprudence, and prevailing social norms in South Korea.
* Posting content that simulates criminal organizations or similar entities.
* Using the instance to harass individuals or groups (discrimination, defamation, etc.). Examples: cyberbullying, hate speech.
* Using the instance with the purpose of inflicting mental or physical harm on individuals or groups. Examples: posting content that may trigger photosensitive epilepsy seizures in individuals with the condition.
* Suspected accounts created by hackers or hacker organizations receiving financial support.
* Reporting the use of copyrighted material beyond the scope permitted by prior disclosure of copyrights.
* When conducting the user protection procedure, it may not be possible to estimate the user's age accurately even after considering the data recorded on the instance. Individuals whose age cannot be estimated may be requested to submit a "Consent Form for the Collection and Provision of Personal Information" and a "Legal Guardian Consent Form" for accurate verification. Refusal to comply may result in direct intervention.

The criteria for determining "individuals whose age cannot be estimated" in the user protection procedure on this instance are as follows:

* Korean language users who demonstrate a level of literacy, vocabulary, comprehension, and sentence structure that is difficult to consider as having received education equivalent to at least the second year of middle school in South Korea. However, individuals whose native language is not Korean are not subject to age estimation.
* English or foreign language users are not subject to age estimation.

This instance has designated a legal representative with the authority to act on behalf of the administrator in situations where the administrator is unable to exercise normal capabilities. The legal representative (referred to as the "technical representative") is prepared for similar circumstances, such as the death or disappearance of the administrator, mental incompetence, being detained or taken hostage in a third country, being wanted by domestic or international judicial institutions, threats from criminal organizations or unknown individuals or groups resulting in hiding, conscription due to war or similar national crisis situations, or any similar situation where contact and location cannot be ascertained for 24 hours or more, as well as any other situation previously announced through all available means.

In the event of a similar situation, the rights transfer of this instance takes precedence for the designated technical representative as appointed by the administrator. If a similar situation arises, the technical representative has the right to exercise those rights within 5 days from the day the technical representative is informed by the administrator (however, if the technical representative is unavailable, the rights will automatically transfer to the legal representative from the day a third party attempts to contact the technical representative to inform them of the similar situation using all possible means).

* Designated Technical Representative: Junyoung Kim (+82-0507-954-5188, juni65423@gmail.com)
* Scope of Technical Representative's Rights: All physical assets (servers, PCs, etc.) necessary for operating this instance, all intangible electronic forms (software, databases, files, etc.), and all cloud service contract terms.
* Limitation of Technical Representative's Rights: The rights of the technical representative are only exercised (acquired) when the administrator is unable to exercise normal capabilities.

By joining this instance, it is considered that you agree to these rules.

These rules will be effective from July 8, 2023, 23:00 UTC+9 (KST).
